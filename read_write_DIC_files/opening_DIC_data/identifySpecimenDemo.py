## """ identifySpecimenDemo.py """ :
##        simple dispZ threshold script: isolate important data...
##        (this script is an edited version of Charles Jekel's
##        "readDataPlotDispField.py" file)
##        run this script in the same folder as file "B00015.dat"
##=============================================================================

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

dicFile = 'B00015.dat'
## the .dat file is hard-coded for demo purposes...

##=============================================================================
## utilizing np.loadtxt  
## see "reduceFileFormatSizeDemo.py" file
##=============================================================================
values = np.loadtxt(dicFile, skiprows = 3)

## the counting standard in python starts iterations with 0...
## therefore, the 1st column of a 2D array is assigned to [:,0] and
## the 2nd column is assigned to [:,2] and so on; 
## the use of ":" indicates "all rows" since python follows the standard
## [row, column] notation.

##    initial X is in the 1st column of "values" a.k.a. "values[:,0]"
##    initial Y is in the 2nd column of "values" a.k.a. "values[:,1]"
##    initial Z is in the 3rd column of "values" a.k.a. "values[:,2]"
##    dispX is in the 4th column of "values", a.k.a. "values[:,3]"
##    dispY is in the 5th column of "values", a.k.a. "values[:,4]" 
##    dispZ is in the 6th column of "values", a.k.a. "values[:,5]"

## the logical constraint "only keep rows with nonzero dispZ"
## is equivalent to "only keep rows with nonzero dispX", but ONLY for 
## pressure data GREATER THAN 0 bar; when there is no pressure, then there
## is no displacement in Z, BUT there is still data from initial Z due to the
## thickness of the specimen.

values_ZeroDispRemoved = values[ (values[:,2] != 0) | (values[:,5] != 0) ]
## the line "values_ZeroDispRemoved = values[values[:,N] != 0]" is read as:
##    "values_ZeroDispRemoved" equals all rows of "values"
##    where the number in the Nth column is not equal to 0...
## therefore, the line
## "values_ZeroDispRemoved = values[ (values[:,2] != 0) | (values[:,5] != 0) ]"
## is read as:
##    "values_ZeroDispRemoved" equals all rows of "values" 
##    where the number in the 3rd column is nonzero
##    OR where the number in the 6th column is nonzero 
## (this acts to conserve specimen data for all pressures)

## now, for displacement data associated with pressures greater than 0 bar:
## the logical constraint "only keep rows with nonzero dispZ"
## is always equivalent to "only keep rows with nonzero initial Z"
## due to the material thickness of the specimen; digital imaging does not
## detect thickness for material clamped within the apparatus, as such,
## both the initial Z value and the dispZ value are 0mm in a 1:1 ratio
## for all data points, i.e., for all rows in "values"

## furthermore, although all initial X & initial Y are nonzero, 
## a displacement in Z will always coincide with a displacement in both X & Y,
## so the statement "only keep rows with nonzero dispZ" is equivalent to
## "only keep rows with nonzero dispX" and is also equivalent to 
## "only keep rows with nonzero dispY"
## check to see:
##    each line below can be used to define "values_ZeroDispRemoved" and will 
##    all result in the same # of remaining data entries;
##    however, for data with pressure 0 bar (generally file "B00001.dat"),
##    each line below defining "values_ZeroDispRemoved" will generally 
##    result in all or most of the data removed

#values_ZeroDispRemoved = values[values[:,3] != 0]
#values_ZeroDispRemoved = values[values[:,4] != 0]
#values_ZeroDispRemoved = values[values[:,5] != 0]

print ('There are')
print (len(values)) 
print ('data entries')

## note: the python length command "len()" has interesting default behavior:
## "len()" will always return the number of rows of a list or array,
## no matter the dimension; therefore in this context, "len(values)"
## returns the total number of (X,Y,Z) data points

## these lines are used when plotting original data:
#X = values[:,0]
#Y = values[:,1]
#Z = values[:,2]
#dispX = values[:,3]
#dispY = values[:,4]
#dispZ = values[:,5]

print ('\nThere are')
print (len(values_ZeroDispRemoved))
print ('data entries when zero-displacement points are removed')

X = values_ZeroDispRemoved[:,0]
Y = values_ZeroDispRemoved[:,1]
Z = values_ZeroDispRemoved[:,2]
dispX = values_ZeroDispRemoved[:,3]
dispY = values_ZeroDispRemoved[:,4]
dispZ = values_ZeroDispRemoved[:,5]

#   plots of the specimen in 3D

ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d') # adding an empty plot to figure...

## the displaced nodes are equal to "X+dispX", "Y+dispY", "Z+dispZ"
finalX = X+dispX
finalY = Y+dispY
finalZ = Z+dispZ

ax.scatter(finalX, finalY, finalZ, zdir='z',\
           s=.2, c='b', depthshade=False, edgecolor='')
## "  zdir='z'  " orients the data so the Z axis is the chosen vertical axis
## "s" = "size"; sets the desired marker size for each data point
##               (per documentation, units are "points^2")
## "c" = "color"; sets the color of the data points
##                ('b' for "blue"; can be set equal to "finalZ" for gradient)
## "depthshade=False"; turns off the depthshade effect, which assigns a lower
##                     alpha value to points "in back" and a higher alpha to 
##                     points "in front"--turning this off results in 
##                     significantly shorter runtime, and due to the large #
##                     of data points, the depthshade effect is not necessary
## "edgecolor=''"; sets the edgecolor to "None" via the blank string ''--
##                 default bahavior of matplotlib is to set the edgecolor of 
##                 markers to the same color as set to the marker, which 
##                 interfered with the desired size of the markers

## defining axes limits: the specimen is revealed when "values_ZeroDispRemoved"
## is plotted; "values" shows the specimen plus test apparatus data points
## (nodes from the apparatus have 0mm Z-displacement by default)

## the maximum and minimum values for both "values" & "values_ZeroDispRemoved"
## can be viewed with the following commands:
#np.max(X+dispX), np.min(X+dispX)
#np.max(Y+dispY), np.min(Y+dispY)
#np.max(Z+dispZ), np.min(Z+dispZ)

## axes limits were chosen by rounding the max & min values 
## and increasing the range by 5mm for maximums and -5mm for minimums
## (conditions were added to handle situations when 0 data points remain)
