# note: the "np.memmap" process is dependent on the "np.loadtxt" process due to
# the need to remove headings from the original text data (see lines 45-46),
# and also due to the required "shape" parameter, which gives the necessary
# array dimensions matching the dimensions of the original data;
# also, " mode='w+' " is explained per documentation:
#    the file is created or the existing file is overwritten 
#    for both reading & writing priveleges
# also, note how the data type is set to "float32" with the parameter "dtype";
# this will be explained in the pros/cons section to follow

# at this point, the file "testResult_MemoryMap.npy" is saved onto disk,
# however, it cannot be deleted or edited directly due to the open memory map

# "fp" represents the memory map with all entries "0" and with the
# same dimensions as the test data...

# on disk can now be deleted or edited directly
# from documentation...
#    deletion flushes memory changes to disk before removing the object

# to retrieve data, a new memory map object is created:
newfp = np.memmap(newFilePath, \

# using " mode='r' ", the map is "read only" to protect from possible edits
# note that the new memory map also requires the correct dimensions
# for the "shape" paramter

# data is retrievable using the newly created memory mapping:
test_MemoryMap_retrieved = np.array(newfp)
# at this point the file "testResult_MemoryMap.npy" is again open not editable
# or able to be deleted due to the open memory map

# now, the file "testResult_MemoryMap.npy" can be deleted because the

##=============================================================================
## cons: can only save memory space if dtype='float32', 
##       if the parameter "dtype" is set to the the original precision float64,
##       the resulting file size is the same as with the "np.loadtext" option;
##       basically, the memory mapping option is equivalent to "np.loadtext"
##       when setting the parameter "dtype" to float32 precision, e.g.:
##       testResult_LoadText = np.loadtxt(dicFile, dtype='float32', skiprows=3)    
## 
## pros: data is still accurate to 5 decimal places, which may be negligible;
##       size of "testResult_MemoryMap.npy" is half of "testResult_LoadText";
##       the additional runtime is quite negligible compared to the runtime
##       seen with the "np.loadtext" option, so this leaves possibilties to 
##       utilize the temp folder or temporary files & delete them after
##

np.savez_compressed('testResult_Zip.npz', zippedArray = testResult_LoadText)
# uses the values from the "np.loadtext" option (and so is also dependent);
# values from the "testResult_LoadText" variable are saved to a new file on
# disk; the new file is named "testResult_Zip.npz" and is saved in the same
# location as this script for the purposes of this demo...
# the ".npz" file extension means "zipped numpy file"
# note: "zippedArray" is an arbitrary callback name to retrieve data, 
# which will be seen later

with np.load('testResult_Zip.npz') as unzipArray:
    test_Zip_retrieved = unzipArray['zippedArray']
# loads the values from "testResult_Zip.npz" into a dictionary-like variable
# called "unzipArray"; this particular syntax using the "with" command makes
# sure that the associated files saved on disk are closed after use 

# the callback "zippedArray" retrieves numbers from the dictionary-like 
# "unzipArray" object...
# per documentation, this is how to retrieve data from compressed numpy files:
#unzipArray = np.load('testResult_Zip.npz')
#test_Zip_retrieved = unzipArray['zippedArray']

# print out the elapsed time for option "numpy.savez_compressed" operation...

## note: "np.savez_compressed" has non-negligible runtime (see print outputs)

##    Other notes:
##    consider using the %timeit command:
#%timeit np.random.random(200)
## 
##    python "pickle" may also be an explorable option
##
##    perhaps look into faster functions besides numpy.save
