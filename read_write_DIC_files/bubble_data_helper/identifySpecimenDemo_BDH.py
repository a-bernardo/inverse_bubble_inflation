## "c" = "color"; sets the color of the data points
##                ('b' for "blue"; can be set equal to "finalZ" for gradient)
## "depthshade=False"; turns off the depthshade effect, which assigns a lower
##                     alpha value to points "in back" and a higher alpha to 
##                     points "in front"--turning this off results in 
##                     significantly shorter runtime, and due to the large #
##                     of data points, the depthshade effect is not necessary
## "edgecolor=''"; sets the edgecolor to "None" via the blank string ''--
##                 default bahavior of matplotlib is to set the edgecolor of 
##                 markers to the same color as set to the marker, which 
##                 interfered with the desired size of the markers

## axes limits were chosen by rounding the max & min values 
## and increasing the range by 5mm for maximums and -5mm for minimums
